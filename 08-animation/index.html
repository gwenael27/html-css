                <p>It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base,
                have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.</p>

                <p>During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's
                ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to
                destroy an entire planet.</p>

                <p>Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her
                starship, custodian of the stolen plan that can save her people and restore
                freedom to the galaxy...</p>
